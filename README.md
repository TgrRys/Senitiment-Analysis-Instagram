# Instagram-Scraper
ðŸª™ Flask Site for scrapping instagram profile posts ðŸª™

Background : 
I'm working full time as a Data Analyst Manager in a Digital Agency company. Therefore I'm in a need of a program that can run or scrape public data of Social Media. 

Problem in hand : 
Sometimes our tools that currently we are subscribe to are having a lot of error, therefore we need to implement another program to become the safety net / another option to scrape public data in Social Media

Solution : 
We created a website-based scraping from python to achieve the needs.

Here's some of the screenshot and layout. Yes the UI still on development, but atleast you can use it for the safety net plan.

I'm using flask as my main site and creating API calls so i can fetch data easily.
